# Governance Protocols for EpochRoot ðŸª¾ Cliff Hub

## Purpose
All strategic, architectural, and operational decisionsâ€”by humans or agentsâ€”must be documented, discussed, and approved via GitHub governance in this repository.

## Governance Rules

### 1. Decision Logging
- Major decisions (product, tech, monetization, etc.) require a GitHub issue with rationale, KPI impact, and escalation history.

### 2. Approval Flows
- Critical changes must be made via PR with mandatory review (human/agent/automated).
- Self-approvals must include audit trail in comments or labels.

### 3. Issue-Driven Development
- All tasks, optimizations, and features are tracked as issues linked to PRs.
- Self-improvement outputs documented as "optimization" issues.

### 4. Escalation & Compliance
- Irreversible/high-risk/compliance-impacting changes trigger escalation to Discussions and assigned reviewers.

### 5. Documentation & Reporting
- All governance logs and self-improvement iterations are archived in this file and /governance directory.
- Strategic updates posted as Release Notes or Wiki entries.

### 6. Transparency & Traceability
- Every workflow, automation, and system change is traceable to its GitHub source (issue/PR/commit/comment).
- All changes tagged with version, date, rationale, and KPI impact.

## Agent Protocols

- All agents must sync decisions and outputs to this repo.
- Agents must link rationale and audit trail in every automated action.
- Agents must auto-sync with other agents via Issues, PRs, and Discussions.
- Agents must escalate for compliance, high-risk, or irreversible actions.

## Audit & Sync Workflow

- Scheduled workflow runs to cross-check agent outputs, decision logs, and KPI dashboards.
- Automated syncing to ensure all agents reference the latest, governed state.
- Agents unable to comply trigger governance escalation via Discussion.

## Continuous Improvement

- Self-improvement cycles logged as issues and tracked for KPI improvement.
- Governance rules reviewed quarterly and updated via PR.
